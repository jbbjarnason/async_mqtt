<p>Receive Maximum is a way to flow control PUBLISH(QoS1, QoS2) packets. They require to store for resending. So the node should prepare the memory packet size * Receive Maximum.
The maximum value of the packet size can be defined using <a href="maximum_packet_size.html">Maximum Packet Size</a>.
If the node sends over the Receive Maximum packets, then it is protocol error. The counter part disconnect the connetion with DISCONNECT packet with Reason Code 0x93 (Receive Maximum exceeded).</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>asnyc_mqtt automatically respect Receive Maximum so user doesn&#8217;t care about that. If user calls send() with PUBLISH (QoS1 or QoS2) packets over received Receive Maximum times before the publish sequence is not finished, async_mqtt queuing the PUBLISH packet internally. When the receive count is decreased, then send the queued PUBLISH packet. The order of sending the PUBLISH is the same as user&#8217;s send() function call order.
There is no explicit limitation for the number of queuing packets. But in order to create PUBLISH (QoS1 or QoS2) packet, user needs to acquire a Packet Identifier. It is limited at most 65535, so it is also the limit of queuing packets.</p>
