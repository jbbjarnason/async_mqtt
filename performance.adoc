= Performance

I've measured how many publishes per second can async_mqtt broker treated.

== Environment

AWS EC2 c5.4xlarge, c5.12xlarge

- Benchmark targets
  - mosquitto version:2.0.11
  - hivemqt-ce-2023.4
  - async_mqtt 1.0.6

Single broker, multiple clients.
clients are genereted by https://github.com/redboltz/async_mqtt/tree/main/docker bench.sh

It publishes packets and receive it. Measure RTT(Round trip time).
Each clinet 100 publish/second (pps). Increase the number of clients until RTT over 1second.
For example, the number of client is 6,000, that means 600,000 (600K) pps.
Publish payload is 1024 bytes.
